// Polymorphism is one of the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming languages where poly means many and morphism means transforming one form into another. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

// In JavaScript, polymorphism works in two primary ways:

// Method Overriding: A child class overrides a method of its parent class.
// Method Overloading (simulated): A function behaves differently based on the number or type of its arguments.

// Method Overriding
// Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. When you call this method, JavaScript will use the subclass's implementation instead of the parent's, which is a runtime decision.

class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Cat meows");
    }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak();

const cat = new Cat();
cat.speak();

// Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
// JavaScript does not natively support method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name but different arguments exist in the same scope. However, method overloading can be simulated by checking the number or type of arguments passed to a function, and executing different logic based on them.


class Calculator {

    add(...numbers) {

        let sum = 0;

        for (let num of numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }

        return sum;
    }
}

const calc = new Calculator();

console.log(calc.add(2));
console.log(calc.add(2, 3));
console.log(calc.add(2, 3, 4));
console.log(calc.add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
